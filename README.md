## Fix Slack's icon in Plasma's system tray:
1. Clone this repo. 
`git clone`
2. Navigating into the folder
`cd slack-fix`
3. Run the shell script OR execute the copy command
`./slackfix.sh`
OR
`sudo cp slack-taskbar-* /usr/lib/slack/resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/`

### Problem statement

On Plasma desktop environment, the system tray icon for Slack ([installed from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slack-desktop/)) has an issue with system tray icon. The size of it is too big as can be seen in the screenshot. I am using Arch Linux so this may be the case for other distributions as well.

### Problem resolution
This repository has the updated Slack icon with 3 possible states (red for highlight, blue for unread and all white for rest).

This is a personal taste so you can change how it looks, using a image manipulation program. (I used GIMP). There's also a 1600x1600 pixels PNG icon included for ease of editing ([downloaded from freebiesupply](https://freebiesupply.com/logos/new-slack-logo-2019/)). Remember to scale to what size you want. I scaled them to 22x22 pixels for my use case.

### Implementation 
Finally, the replacement of icons. There exists a shell script which replaces the old icons with the new ones included in this repo.
You can run `./slackfix.sh` and restart Slack to see the changes.
All this script contains is this copy command.
`sudo cp slack-taskbar-* /usr/lib/slack/resources/app.asar.unpacked/src/static/`

**Note**: This issue does not exist when Slack was installed using [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.slack.Slack). I prefer using AUR so this issue bugs me.

This was inspired form [lgodlewski's Medium article](https://medium.com/@l.godlewski/how-to-fix-slack-icon-in-kde-312383c331a9). It has the old Slack icon so I updated them with the new ones.
